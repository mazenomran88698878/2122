# Login Form Project

This is a responsive login form built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project includes form validation, interactive animations, and a modern design. It is ideal for use as a login page in your web applications.

## Getting Started

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps. You'll need **Visual Studio Code** for editing the code and **XAMPP** for running a local development environment (especially if you're planning to implement server-side functionalities like PHP or MySQL integration).

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need the following:

- **Visual Studio Code**: A powerful code editor that supports HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many other web technologies. You can download it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **XAMPP**: A free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package. It's used to set up a local server environment that supports PHP, MySQL, and Apache. Download it from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
- **Node.js** (optional): If you're planning to use npm for managing packages or running scripts.

To install required packages or dependencies (if applicable), run the following command:
